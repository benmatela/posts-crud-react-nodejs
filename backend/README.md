# Backend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How it works:


* Backend for `/frontend` Post app.
* Allows CRUD operations 


# Pre-requisites
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.13.1
- `/backend` should be running. See the README file inside for how to run it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
